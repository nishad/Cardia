# Cardia
Cardia is a rapid-response heart health app for the Jawbone UP3 made for the 2015 Women's Health Codeathon.

Given a set of Jawbone data on heart rate, respiration rate, and sleep disruptions, Cardia detects hyperventilations, tachycardias, and other heart health events, and sends notifications when these events exceed a certain threshold of intensity. The notifications ask the user to describe any current symptoms they are feeling, and the app combines this feedback with pre-computed risk estimates to serve up recommendations for action (for example, an acute event combined with serious symptoms might be met with a recommendation to stop immediately and seek help).

The code produced was a simple conceptual demo using synthetic data.
